# Description:
# As any Naoqi program, is compile using qibuild with the Cross-Platform
# ToolChain provide by Aldebaran. This script, compiles 'movehead.cpp' and copy
# the executable to the NAO using ssh, and run it inmediatly (optional).
#
# RUN:
#  ./make.sh <NAO_IP>
#
# This makefile create a folder named 'build-puppeteerTC' where you can find
# all the created files of the compilation. Exactly in:
# 	./build-puppeteerTC/sdk/bin
# you will find the executable file (Puppet) which this script place it in  
# NAO's processor to be run. 
# To connect the NAO use: 
#		 ssh nao@<NAO_IP>
# 	 password = nao
# and then run the program with:  
#		 ./Puppet
